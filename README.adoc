# Idea
This project realizes a home security application with a Raspberry Pi.
The Raspberry Pi hosts a Spring Boot application which represents the core of the
this project. It is connected to a camera and a movement sensor and acts on a detected
movements. The Raspberry Pi will host the main application represented by a Spring Boot
application which provides a REST-API for configuration purpose and push notifications to the clients.
Also the application manages the connected sensors. +

An android admin app allows the owner of the security domain to configure the  system and to register
users, who get notified if an security issues occurs. The users will have the client app
installed on their android devices which are capable of receiving push notifications of the app server
in case of an security issue. +

The clients are registered on the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Service provided by Google
and will get the notifications pushed to them via this service. The REST-Server will act
as the app server which manages the client apps which are part of the security domain and assigned
to registered users. +

# Hardware
The main hardware is a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B which hosts the Spring Boot application and has a movements sensor
and a camera connected to it. The hardware for the internet connection is already provided by the
Raspberry Pi.

# Software
The main part of the software is the Spring Boot application which hosts a REST-API and provides the main logic
for interacting with the sensors. The library __PI4J__ For is used for interacting with the connected hardware.
The database is provided by a __MongoDB__ server. A __Nginx__ service is used as a reverse proxy. Docker is used to isolate the service from each other and
to provide the possibility to deploy updates and upgrades for the database and spring boot application without the need to modify the host. +

The Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCW) service is used to push notifications to the registered clients of the users.
